# AdventOfCode_2019

My solutions for the Advent of Code 2019 puzzles.

## Tools

* Python 3.6 with venv in PyCharm.
* Use standard library built-ins as much as possible (in other words: imports only when needed).

## Practices

* Finding solutions while writing robust code is my main priority.
* TDD: test first, code second.
* Optimize when I am bored or I get fed up when my code is being slow.
